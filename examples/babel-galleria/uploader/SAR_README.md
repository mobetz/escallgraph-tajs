# uploader

Serverless web application for uploading files to S3

This application is designed to be used with [serverless-galleria](https://github.com/evanchiu/serverless-galleria), but it can also function as a generic web to S3 file uploader.

## Deploy
* Create an S3 bucket to hold the uploaded content
  * Note that if you're using a [serverless-galleria](https://github.com/evanchiu/serverless-galleria) image processing pipeline, the bucket you'll upload to will be created by the transform
* Hit "Deploy" from the [application](https://serverlessrepo.aws.amazon.com/#/applications/arn:aws:serverlessrepo:us-east-1:233054207705:applications~uploader) page
