# compress

Copy and compress images using Lambda.

## Deploy with CloudFormation

Prerequisites: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [AWS CLI](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html) installed

* Create an [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) Account and [IAM User](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/) with the `AdministratorAccess` AWS [Managed Policy](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_managed-vs-inline.html)
* Run `aws configure` to put store that user's credentials in `~/.aws/credentials`
* Create an S3 bucket for storing the Lambda code and store its name in a shell variable with:
  * `export CODE_BUCKET=bucket`
* Create the S3 bucket for the compressed output, store its name in shell variable:
  * `export DEST_BUCKET=bucket`
* Choose a name, but do NOT create the S3 bucket input comes from, store its name in shell variable:
  * `export SOURCE_BUCKET=bucket`
* Choose the JPEG compression quality, 1 to 100, 100 is best quality/largest file, (See [docs](http://www.graphicsmagick.org/GraphicsMagick.html#details-quality)), store it in shell variable:
  * `export QUALITY=25`
* Npm install:
  * `npm install`
* Build:
  * `npm run build`
* Upload package to S3, transform the CloudFormation template:
  * `npm run package`
* Deploy to CloudFormation:
  * `npm run deploy`

## Deploy from the AWS Serverless Application Repository
* Create the destination bucket
* Hit "Deploy" from the [application](https://serverlessrepo.aws.amazon.com/#/applications/arn:aws:serverlessrepo:us-east-1:233054207705:applications~compress) page

## Use
* Images that you put into the source bucket will be transformed, then put into the destination bucket
